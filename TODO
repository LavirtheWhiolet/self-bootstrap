- Enforce UTF-8 encoding in output stream.
- Ability to set output file or stream.
- "to_ruby_code(string)" function.
- Code predicates ("&{ some_code }").
- Check "U+HHHH" codes with code predicates.
- Error reporting (at least position). Idea: @max_pos, @max_error, @yy_file.
- Analogues of "+", "*" and "?" in beginning of the expression repeated. Maybe "?:expr", "*:expr", "+:expr"?
- Rename the parser generator's executable file to "generate_parser" and make it not "require"-able (this property is not needed).
- Byte parsing expression ("FFh DEh DDh"). Syntax for sequence of byte expressions.
- Revert capture expressions ("expr:var" instead of "var:expr").
- Capture expressions: variables in brackets ("expr:(var)"). It will help when variables will get types ("expr:(var:Type)"). May be use square brackets?
- Code#+(string).
- "{... <code> ...}".
- Use "RubyCode" as value of "action" rule.
- Allow to set error message in code predicates.
