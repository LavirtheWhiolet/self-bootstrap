- Enforce UTF-8 encoding in output stream.
- Ability to set output file or stream.
- "to_ruby_code(string)" function.
- Error reporting (at least position). Idea: @yy_max_pos, @yy_max_error, @yy_file.
- Analogues of "+", "*" and "?" in beginning of the expression repeated. Maybe "?:expr", "*:expr", "+:expr"?
- Rename the parser generator's executable file to "generate_parser" and make it not "require"-able (this property is not needed).
- Byte parsing expression ("FF DE DDh"). Interpret the expression as a single big number.
- Revert capture expressions ("expr:var" instead of "var:expr").
- Capture expressions: variables in brackets ("expr:(var)"). It will help when variables will get types ("expr:(var:Type)"). May be use square brackets?
- Code#+(string).
